# memorize
This program is for helping memorize words and their translations.  
Compile the program, copy the file List.txt from the folder "initial data" to the folder where the exe is located.  Edit the List.txt file to include your list of words instead (a tab delimited list of words and their translation).  
Run the program, hit enter repeatedly to show the translation of the current word and move to the next word.
